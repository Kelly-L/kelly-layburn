					<h2>A little bit about me.</h2>					
					<div class="half-width">
						<p>Originally from Long Island, NY, my home base is now in Charlotte, NC  with my small family. My journey into technology started with a Bachelor's Degree in Visual Communications. I started as a graphic designer mostly for print.  I soon became fascinated with learning to code designs for the web for it's streamlined approach to publication and the demand for work in this area. As I set out to explore coding for the web, I became immediately hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="half-width">
						<p>Upon building my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. That curiosity then opened a door and earned me my first position as a web designer for a public university.  After putting my career on hold for a while to raise a family, I am back in the saddle and have made a switch from design to mostly front-end development, where I can use my background in design, organization skills, and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

							<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
